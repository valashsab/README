<h1 align="left">Greetings ðŸ‘‹,  I'm Valerie Sabando</h1>

I'm a <b>full stack developer</b> based in Vienna, Austria with a background in customer service. Having a keen eye for detail, I'm committed to delivering smooth user experience.

I'm enthusiastic about exploring GraphQL and soaking up as much as I can.

I'm currently developing with JavaScript, Typescricript, React and Next.js.
